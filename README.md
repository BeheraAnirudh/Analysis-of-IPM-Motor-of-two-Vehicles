Analysis and Comparison of Interior Permanent Magnet Motors of Two Different EV
This paper presents an analysis andcomparison of two electric motors.These machines are permanent magnet machines. The first machine is a DC brushless interior permanent magnet motor. This motor has an output of 225KW and torque 375 Nm. The Second machine is an Interior permanent magnet motor. This motor has an output of 80KW and torque of 280 Nm. The Electromagnetic Analysis, Speed- Torque curves, Efficiency maps and Thermal analysis were determined and compared.The Conclusions of the machine performance were made.
